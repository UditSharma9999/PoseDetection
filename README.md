# PoseDetection
It is website/webpage build on a react js using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Capable of performing the following things
 - FacialLandmarkDetection
 - GestureRecognition
 - HandPoseDetection
 - RealTimeBodySegmentation
 - RealTimeObjectDetection

***

***Facial Landmark Detection*** <br/>
Face landmark detection is a computer vision task where we want to detect and track keypoints from a human face. This task applies to many problems. For example, we can use the keypoints for detecting a human's head pose position and rotation. With that, we can track whether a driver is paying attention or not

***Gesture Recognition*** <br/>
Gesture recognition is a type of perceptual computing user interface that allows computers to capture and interpret human gestures as commands.

***Hand PoseDetection***<br/>
Hand Pose Estimation/Detection aims to predict the position of joints on a hand from an image

***Body Segmentation***<br/>
The task of clustering parts of an image together that belong to the same object class. This process is also called pixel-level classification. In other words, it involves partitioning images (or video frames) into multiple segments or objects
